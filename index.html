        <h1>FindArtists</h1>
        <p>FindArtists is an python app to find and gather information on well-known musicians and recording artists.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The idea to find information on musicians came when Charlie Marshall needed to conduct market research into the electronic industry. 
            In particular, information on popular artists within the industry. 
            Most data-vendors were unreliable, did not hold required information that was being looked for or were far too expensive.
            Searching for this data manually would've been a slow, tedious process, given the necessary number of artists to find information for.
        </p>

        <h2>The App</h2>
        <p>
            To solve this problem, the idea came to produce and app that would quickly acquire this data from free, from public sources.
            Namely, Wikipedia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using PyWikibot library, FindArtists searches for a user-defined collection of popular artist names on wikipedia. It then identifies the appropriate WikiData page and gathers the desired data on the desired artists.
